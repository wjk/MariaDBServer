        <b>Important Note:</b> Due to a bug in macOS, the MariaDB service will not
        start if its log files are deleted. This may happen as a side-effect of installing
        macOS updates. If this happens, reinstalling MariaDB (using this installer) will
        fix the problem. No databases will be affected if you do this.
